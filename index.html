            <p>In some circles, Ben Hogan is credited with “inventing practice.”

                Hogan was one of the greatest golfers of the 20th century, an accomplishment he achieved through
                tireless
                repetition. He simply loved to practice. Hogan said, “I couldn't wait to get up in the morning so I
                could
                hit balls. I'd be at the practice tee at the crack of dawn, hit balls for a few hours, then take a break
                and
                get right back to it.”

                For Hogan, every practice session had a purpose. He reportedly spent years breaking down each phase of
                the
                golf swing and testing new methods for each segment. The result was near perfection. He developed one of
                the
                most finely-tuned golf swings in the history of the game.

                His precision made him more like a surgeon than a golfer. During the 1953 Masters, for example, Hogan
                hit
                the flagstick on back-to-back holes. A few days later, he broke the tournament scoring record.</p>
